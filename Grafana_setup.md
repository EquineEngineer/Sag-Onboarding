## Dashboard problems

### Panel not found

You might face this error message if open a dashboard for the first time
> [!NOTE]
> The name of the plugin might be different, in this case it is `smartcomm-multiplelinechart-panel`

![Screenshot 2023-08-31 191828](https://github.com/bobokrut/Sag-Onboarding/assets/45918782/83899e5f-c21a-4097-8b0b-eb12192bf896)

Dataskope team develops their own plugins, and in order to fix this issue you will need to build their plugins/panel manually. 

1. In the `SmartCommunities` repo navigate to `grafana-9.3.6_E_DB1/data/plugins/`
```bash
cd grafana-9.3.6_E_DB1/data/plugins/
```
2. Go to the directory with the same name as the in the error message (in this case it is `smartcomm-multiplelinechart-panel`
```bash
cd smartcomm-multiplelinechart-panel
```
3. Install and build everything
```bash
yarn install && yarn dev --no-watch
```
> [!NOTE]
> You might see some errors during build. You can ignore them unless you can build the plugin (`error Command failed with exit code 1.` might be also fine

4. Verify that everything works
Restart the server. Then go to the dashboard and if error is gone then you are good to go. If not, please contact Egor

### Can't load/edit dashboard JSON
If loading of the json file takes forever you might nned to add monaco editor to the current branch. 
1. Verify that monaco editor is missing
    1. Navigate to the `public/lib/`
    ```bash
    cd public/lib/
    ```
    2. List directories
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    If you don't see `monaco` directory then procced to the next step. If it's there then you have a different problemðŸ¤·

2. Download the monaco editor
You can the `monaco` editor from the other branches (e.g. `feature_extremeValues`), however you download it from my google drive as a `zip` file and unzip it. (you need to be in the `public/lib/` directory)

```bash
wget "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1nfxchDda2NOgK5bq-O9oWgE3hb1SbOBX" -O monaco.zip
unzip monaco.zip
```
> [!NOTE]
> In case you don't have access to the file please contact Egor

3. Restart the server
